  <p><strong>Type "Goku vs Frieza" — get a full anime roast-battle video.</strong></p>

  <p>
    AnimeRoom turns a single prompt into a cinematic 9:16 anime roast battle:
    AI writes the script, generates every character image, voices every line,
    and streams the video to you live as it renders — round by round.

## What it does

You type a matchup like `Naruto vs Sasuke`. AnimeRoom then:

1. **Writes the battle** — an LLM scripts the characters, their stats, and a multi-round roast exchange.
2. **Generates the visuals** — each character pose and expression is image-generated per round.
3. **Voices every line** — dialogue and announcer audio are synthesized to speech.
4. **Assembles a video** — intros, stat screens, battle rounds, and audio are composited into a vertical 9:16 video.
5. **Streams it live** — you watch rounds appear in real time instead of staring at a spinner.

Then a full editor lets you regenerate any image, rewrite any line, or re-record any clip before exporting.

## Features

- **AI roast battles** — full scripts written from a single prompt
- **Live generation** — rounds stream in over a realtime channel as they're produced
- **Cinematic output** — 9:16 video with character intros, stat cards, rounds, and dynamic audio
- **Per-round image generation** — unique poses/expressions for every beat
- **Full editor** — regenerate images, rewrite dialogue, re-record audio, total control
- **Credits & billing** — Stripe-backed credit packs with webhook-driven fulfillment

## How it works

┌─────────────┐   Inngest orchestrates the pipeline as durable steps:

└─────────────┘
    │           ├─ Images    → Replicate (fast inference)
    │           ├─ Voice     → ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 (via Replicate)
    │           └─ Assets    → Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)
    ▼
┌─────────────┐   State is emitted over Upstash Realtime after each step,
│  REALTIME   │   so the client renders the video as it grows.
└─────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────┐   Remotion Player previews live; Remotion Lambda renders
│    VIDEO    │   the final MP4 export.
└─────────────┘
```

The heavy work runs as **event-driven Inngest functions** (`src/inngest/`) so a job survives
restarts and long-running renders, while the **progressive streaming** layer
(`src/lib/realtime/`) pushes each completed step to the browser.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10+
- A PostgreSQL database (a local Docker helper is included: `./start-database.sh`)
- Accounts / API keys for the services above (see `.env.example`)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
#    then fill in your keys — every value in .env.example is required
#    (Stripe/Inngest have local-friendly defaults noted inline)

# 3. Start a local Postgres (optional helper)
./start-database.sh

# 4. Apply the database schema
pnpm db:push

# 5. Run the app
pnpm dev
```

The app runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To exercise the generation pipeline locally, run the Inngest dev server in a second terminal:

```bash
pnpm inngest:dev
```
